## R Markdown

This file is to analyze the data provided by WRAL in NC regarding donations that should have been banned.

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# Load the tidyverse.
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load the donation data


```{r}
donation <- read_csv('donors0103-0701.csv')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
